# Lyrics
# Everyone considered him the coward of the county
# He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
# His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him Yellow
# But something always told me, they were reading Tommy wrong
# He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
# I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
# I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
# "Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun"
# "Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
# Walk away from trouble if you can
# Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
# I hope you're old enough to understand
# Son, you don't have to fight to be a man"
# There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Becky
# In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
# One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
# They took turns at Becky an' there was three of them
# Tommy opened up the door and saw Becky crying
# The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
# He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
# As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again
# "Promise me, Son, not to do the things I've done
# Walk away from trouble if you can
# Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
# I hope you're old enough to understand
# Son, you don't have to fight to be a man"
# The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the bar room
# One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
# When Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look! Old Yellow's leaving"
# But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door
# Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
# He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
# When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
# He said, "This one's for Becky", as he watched the last one fall
# And I heard him say
# "I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
# I walk away from trouble when I can
# Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
# And Papa, I should hope you understand
# Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man"
# Everyone considered him the coward of the county
